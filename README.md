#  3D Car Racing Game

Built to better learn Swift and its various libraries while still a novice programmer. Based off of the iOS app Jet Car Stunts my version is a beginners attempt at figuring out how that game worked. Uses calculus to programmatically create the tracks.

 Initial goal of creating 4 tracks was not reached.

 Players can drive forward, backward, break and use a jet for an added boost in whatever direction they are going. Steering is done using the devices accelerometer. Position of every block that makes up each track determined with 3 dimentional position function and the arctan of its partial derivatives for the rotation.
